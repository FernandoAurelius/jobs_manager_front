### **Task ID:** TASK-VUE-001

**Title:** Input Validation for "Estimated Materials" Field
**Priority:** High
**Effort Estimate:** S
**Objective:** To prevent non-numeric characters from being entered into the "estimated materials" field in the job creation form, ensuring data integrity.
**Affected Files:**

- `src/views/JobCreateView.vue`

**Detailed Implementation Plan:**

1.  **Locate Input Element:** In `src/views/JobCreateView.vue`, find the `<input>` element with `id="estimatedMaterials"` (line 82).
2.  **Add `@keydown` Event Listener:** Attach a `@keydown` event listener to the input field to intercept key presses.
    ```html
    <input
      id="estimatedMaterials"
      type="number"
      step="0.01"
      min="0"
      v-model.number="formData.estimatedMaterials"
      class="..."
      placeholder="Enter materials cost"
      @keydown="filterNumericInput"
    />
    ```
3.  **Implement `filterNumericInput` Method:** In the `<script setup>` section of `src/views/JobCreateView.vue`, create the `filterNumericInput` method.
4.  **Define Key-Press Logic:** Inside `filterNumericInput`, implement logic to permit only numeric digits (0-9), control keys (Backspace, Delete, Tab, Escape, Enter), arrow keys, and a single decimal point. Prevent all other key presses using `event.preventDefault()`. To handle paste events, we should also add a `@change` handler to re-validate the input.

    ```typescript
    const filterNumericInput = (event: KeyboardEvent) => {
      // Allow control keys, arrow keys, and numeric keys on numpad
      if (
        [
          'Backspace',
          'Delete',
          'Tab',
          'Escape',
          'Enter',
          'ArrowLeft',
          'ArrowRight',
          'ArrowUp',
          'ArrowDown',
        ].includes(event.key) ||
        event.ctrlKey ||
        event.metaKey // Allow Ctrl/Cmd shortcuts
      ) {
        return
      }

      const inputElement = event.target as HTMLInputElement

      // Allow a single decimal point
      if (event.key === '.' && !inputElement.value.includes('.')) {
        return
      }

      // Allow digits
      if (/\d/.test(event.key)) {
        return
      }

      // Prevent all other characters
      event.preventDefault()
    }
    ```

5.  **Add a Sanitization handler on Change:** To handle pasted values, create a simple handler for the `@change` event on the input field.
    ```html
    <input ... @change="sanitizeMaterialsInput" />
    ```
    ```typescript
    const sanitizeMaterialsInput = (event: Event) => {
      const target = event.target as HTMLInputElement
      const sanitizedValue = parseFloat(target.value)
      if (isNaN(sanitizedValue) || sanitizedValue < 0) {
        formData.value.estimatedMaterials = null
      } else {
        formData.value.estimatedMaterials = sanitizedValue
      }
    }
    ```

**UI/UX Enhancement Notes:**

- **Real-time Feedback:** The existing dynamic classes on the input field, which change the border to red on invalid input, are effective. No changes are needed here.
- **Focus State:** The current `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500` provides clear visual feedback and should be maintained.

**QA & Acceptance Criteria:**

- **[ ] Functional:** The user can only type numeric digits (0-9) into the "estimated materials" field.
- **[ ] Functional:** The user can use control keys like Backspace, Delete, and arrow keys.
- **[ ] Functional:** The user can enter a single decimal point (e.g., `123.45`).
- **[ ] Functional:** The user is prevented from entering a second decimal point.
- **[ ] Functional:** The user is prevented from entering letters (e.g., 'e') or symbols.
- **[ ] Functional:** Pasting a non-numeric string (e.g., "abc") into the field is sanitized on blur/change, resulting in a null/empty value.
- **[ ] UI:** The field border turns red if the field is empty or contains an invalid value.
- **[ ] Edge Case:** The form can be submitted correctly with a valid numeric value (e.g., `500.75`) or `0`.

### **Task ID:** TASK-VUE-002

**Title:** Default Contact Person Selection
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort Estimate:** M
**Objective:** To automatically fetch and select the primary contact person in the "Contact" field when a client is chosen in the "Client" lookup component.
**Affected Files:**

- `src/views/JobCreateView.vue`
- `src/components/ContactSelector.vue`
- `src/composables/useContactManagement.ts`

**Detailed Implementation Plan:**

**Phase 1: Investigation Findings**

1.  **Schema Analysis:** The `ClientSearchResult` schema in `src/api/generated/api.ts` (line 486) does **not** contain `main_contact_id` or `main_contact_name`. It has `id`, `name`, `email`, etc., but no direct contact person data. The `raw_json` field is a potential but unreliable source.
2.  **Contact Fetching Logic:** The composable `useContactManagement.ts` contains the function `loadContacts(clientId)`. This function calls the API endpoint `api.clients_contacts_retrieve({ params: { client_id: clientId } })`. This is the authoritative way to get contacts for a given client.
3.  **Primary Contact Identification:** The `ClientContactResult` schema (line 440 in `api.ts`) contains an `is_primary: z.boolean()` field. The `useContactManagement` composable already has a helper function `findPrimaryContact()` that iterates through the loaded contacts to find the one marked as primary.
4.  **Conclusion:** The correct strategy is to use the selected `client.id` to trigger a new API call to fetch all contacts for that client, identify the primary contact from the results, and then set it.

**Phase 2: Step-by-Step Implementation**

1.  **Expose `ContactSelector` Instance:** In `src/views/JobCreateView.vue`, create a template ref for the `ContactSelector` component to allow the parent to call its methods.
    ```html
    <!-- In JobCreateView.vue -->
    <ContactSelector ref="contactSelectorRef" ... />
    ```
    ```typescript
    // In JobCreateView.vue <script setup>
    import ContactSelector from '@/components/ContactSelector.vue' // ensure type is imported if needed
    const contactSelectorRef = ref<InstanceType<typeof ContactSelector> | null>(null)
    ```
2.  **Expose Method from `ContactSelector`:** In `src/components/ContactSelector.vue`, the `selectPrimaryContact` method is already exposed via `defineExpose` (line 221). This is correct.
3.  **Modify `handleClientSelection` in `JobCreateView.vue`:** Update the `handleClientSelection` method (line 259) to call the `selectPrimaryContact` method on the `ContactSelector` instance via its ref. Use `nextTick` to ensure the `clientId` prop is updated in the child component before calling its method.

    ```typescript
    // In src/views/JobCreateView.vue
    import { nextTick } from 'vue' // Make sure nextTick is imported

    const handleClientSelection = async (client: ClientSearchResult | null) => {
      selectedClient.value = client

      // Clear contact person when client changes
      formData.value.contact_person = ''
      if (contactSelectorRef.value) {
        contactSelectorRef.value.clearSelection()
      }

      if (client) {
        formData.value.client_name = client.name
        formData.value.client_id = client.id

        // Wait for the next DOM update cycle to ensure the ref is ready
        // and the new client ID has propagated to the ContactSelector.
        await nextTick()

        if (contactSelectorRef.value) {
          // The `selectPrimaryContact` method within the composable
          // will handle loading contacts and finding the primary.
          await contactSelectorRef.value.selectPrimaryContact()
        }
      } else {
        // Clear client fields if client is deselected
        formData.value.client_name = ''
        formData.value.client_id = ''
      }
    }
    ```

4.  **Update `formData` from Event:** In `JobCreateView.vue`, listen for the `@update:selectedContact` event from `ContactSelector` to update the parent's `formData`.

    ```html
    <!-- In JobCreateView.vue -->
    <ContactSelector
      ref="contactSelectorRef"
      ...
      @update:selected-contact="updateSelectedContact"
    />
    ```

    ```typescript
    // In JobCreateView.vue <script setup>
    import type { ClientContact } from '@/composables/useClientLookup' // Or from generated types

    const updateSelectedContact = (contact: ClientContact | null) => {
      if (contact) {
        // Use the name for the form data, as it's the most reliable field
        formData.value.contact_person = contact.name
      } else {
        formData.value.contact_person = ''
      }
    }
    ```

**UI/UX Enhancement Notes:**

- **Loading State:** While contacts are being fetched, the "Contact" field should ideally show a subtle loading indicator. This can be managed within the `ContactSelector` by leveraging the `isLoading` ref from `useContactManagement`.
- **User Override:** The user must still be able to click on the "Contact" field to open the modal and select a different contact person. The automatic selection should only set a default state.

**QA & Acceptance Criteria:**

- **[ ] Functional:** When a client is selected, an API call is made to fetch its contacts.
- **[ ] Functional:** If a primary contact exists, it is automatically selected and displayed in the "Contact" field.
- **[ ] Functional:** If no primary contact exists, the "Contact" field remains empty.
- **[ ] Functional:** If the client selection is changed or cleared, the "Contact" field is cleared and the process repeats for the new client.
- **[ ] Functional:** The user can still manually open the contact selection modal and override the default selection.
- **[ ] Performance:** The contact fetching process should be quick and not block the UI. A loading indicator should be present if the call is slow.

### **Task ID:** TASK-VUE-003

**Title:** Component Migration: Modals to Tabs
**Priority:** High
**Effort Estimate:** L
**Objective:** To migrate the UI and functionality from `src/components/job/JobSettingsModal.vue` and `src/components/job/JobWorkflowModal.vue` into their respective tab components, adapting the layout from a modal to a tabbed interface within `src/views/JobView.vue`.
**Affected Files:**

- `src/components/job/JobSettingsTab.vue`
- `src/components/job/JobWorkflowTab.vue`
- `src/components/job/JobSettingsModal.vue` (for reference)
- `src/components/job/JobWorkflowModal.vue` (for reference)
- `src/views/JobView.vue`

**Detailed Implementation Plan:**

**Part A: Migrate `JobSettingsModal` to `JobSettingsTab`**

1.  **Copy Template Structure:** In `src/components/job/JobSettingsTab.vue`, replace the placeholder content with the `<div class="grid ...">` layout from `JobSettingsModal.vue` (line 9). Exclude the `DialogHeader` and `DialogFooter` as they are modal-specific.
2.  **Copy Script Logic:** Transfer the entire `<script setup>` content from `JobSettingsModal.vue` to `JobSettingsTab.vue`.
3.  **Adapt Props and Emits:** The tab component already expects a `jobData` prop. Remove the `isOpen` prop and `close` emit. The `job-updated` emit is essential and must be retained to communicate changes back to the parent `JobView`.
4.  **Refactor State Management:** The `watch` effect that reacts to `props.jobData` (line 313 in the modal) to initialize `localJobData` remains valid and should be kept.
5.  **Create Save Button:** Add a "Save Changes" button at the bottom of the tab's content, outside the grid layout. This button will trigger the existing `saveSettings` method.
    ```html
    <!-- In JobSettingsTab.vue, after the grid div -->
    <div class="mt-8 pt-6 border-t border-gray-200 flex justify-end">
      <button
        @click="saveSettings"
        type="button"
        :disabled="isLoading"
        class="px-6 py-2 text-sm font-medium text-white bg-blue-600 rounded-md hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-blue-500 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
      >
        <span v-if="isLoading">Saving...</span>
        <span v-else>Save Changes</span>
      </button>
    </div>
    ```
6.  **Remove Modal-Specific Logic:** Remove all imports and references to `Dialog` components and modal-control logic (`closeModal`, etc.).

**Part B: Migrate `JobWorkflowModal` to `JobWorkflowTab`**

1.  **Copy Template Structure:** Similar to Part A, copy the core template content from `JobWorkflowModal.vue` (the inner `div` from line 11) into `JobWorkflowTab.vue`. Exclude dialog components.
2.  **Copy Script Logic:** Transfer the script logic from `JobWorkflowModal.vue` to `JobWorkflowTab.vue`.
3.  **Adapt Props and Emits:** The `jobData` prop is already defined. Remove `isOpen` and `close`. The `job-updated` emit must be added to `defineEmits` to notify the parent of changes. The `saveWorkflow` function should be modified to emit this event upon successful save.
4.  **Refactor State and Save Logic:** The `localJobData` state and the `saveWorkflow` method can be transferred directly. Add a "Save Changes" button to the tab's template to trigger this method.

**Part C: Integrate Tabs into `JobView.vue`**

1.  **Locate Tab Container:** In `src/views/JobView.vue`, the `JobViewTabs` component (line 73) is responsible for rendering the active tab. Its logic will correctly render tab content.
2.  **Remove Modal Logic:** In `src/views/JobView.vue`:
    - Delete the component instances for `<JobSettingsModal ... />` and `<JobWorkflowModal ... />` (lines 159-171).
    - Remove the corresponding import statements (lines 207-208).
    - Delete the state variables `showSettingsModal` and `showWorkflowModal` (lines 278-279).
    - Delete the handler functions `openSettingsModal` and `openWorkflowModal` (lines 312-317).
3.  **Update Event Handlers:** The `@open-settings` and `@open-workflow` event listeners on `JobViewTabs` are now obsolete and should be removed from `src/views/JobView.vue` (lines 80-81). The buttons that triggered these events in `JobViewTabs` should be updated to emit `@change-tab` instead, passing the appropriate tab name (e.g., `'settings'`).

**UI/UX Enhancement Notes:**

- **Layout:** The grid layouts should be wrapped in a container with `max-w-7xl mx-auto` to prevent excessive stretching on wide screens.
- **Visual Separation:** Use `Card` components or subtle borders (`border-b`) with clear headings (`<h3 class="text-lg font-medium">`) to group related fields within the tabs.
- **Stateful Save Button:** The save button should have clear `disabled`, `loading`, `hover`, and `focus` states.
- **Transitions:** The content of the active tab should appear with a gentle fade-in transition for a smoother user experience. This can be achieved by wrapping the dynamic component in `JobViewTabs` with a `<Transition>` tag.

**QA & Acceptance Criteria:**

- **[ ] Functional:** All editing functionality from `JobSettingsModal` is present and works correctly within `JobSettingsTab`.
- **[ ] Functional:** All editing functionality from `JobWorkflowModal` is present and works correctly within `JobWorkflowTab`.
- **[ ] Functional:** Saving changes in either tab updates the central Pinia store and reflects those changes across the application.
- **[ ] UI:** The `JobSettingsModal` and `JobWorkflowModal` components are no longer used or imported in `JobView.vue`.
- **[ ] UI:** The layout within the tabs is well-structured, readable, and visually consistent with the rest of the application.
- **[ ] Responsiveness:** The new tab layouts are responsive and usable on various screen sizes.

### **Task ID:** TASK-VUE-004

**Title:** UI/UX Refinement for Job View Tabs
**Priority:** Medium
**Effort Estimate:** L
**Objective:** To overhaul the UI/UX of existing and newly migrated tabs (`JobHistoryTab`, `JobAttachmentsTab`, `JobPdfTab`, `JobSettingsTab`, `JobWorkflowTab`) to create a polished, well-formatted, and visually appealing user experience.
**Affected Files:**

- `src/components/job/JobHistoryTab.vue`
- `src/components/job/JobAttachmentsTab.vue`
- `src/components/job/JobPdfTab.vue`
- `src/components/job/JobSettingsTab.vue`
- `src/components/job/JobWorkflowTab.vue`
- `src/assets/main.css` (or equivalent global style file)

**Detailed Implementation Plan:**

1.  **Standardize Tab Container Layout:**

    - In each of the five affected tab components, wrap the entire content in a standardized container to control padding and max-width. This ensures consistency.

    ```html
    <!-- Apply to each tab component's root template -->
    <div class="p-4 sm:p-6 lg:p-8 h-full overflow-y-auto bg-gray-50/50">
      <div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto">
        <!-- Tab Content Goes Here -->
      </div>
    </div>
    ```

2.  **Refactor `JobHistoryTab.vue`:**

    - **Collapsible Form:** Use the `Collapsible` component from `src/components/ui/collapsible`. Import `Collapsible` and `CollapsibleContent` from `'@/components/ui/collapsible`. Create a local `ref` (`isAddEventOpen`) to control the `:open` state of the `Collapsible` component. The "Add Event" button will act as the trigger, toggling this `ref`.

      ```vue
      <!-- In JobHistoryTab.vue -->
      <script setup>
      import { ref } from 'vue'
      import { Collapsible, CollapsibleContent } from '@/components/ui/collapsible'
      const isAddEventOpen = ref(false)
      </script>
      <template>
        ...
        <button @click="isAddEventOpen = !isAddEventOpen" class="flex items-center ...">
          <!-- Add a chevron icon that rotates based on isAddEventOpen state -->
          <span>Add Event</span>
        </button>

        <Collapsible :open="isAddEventOpen" class="mt-4">
          <CollapsibleContent>
            <!-- The existing "Add Event" form goes here -->
          </CollapsibleContent>
        </Collapsible>
        ...
      </template>
      ```

    - **Visual Timeline:** Rework the event list into a timeline. For each event, create a `Card`-like container. Use `::before` pseudo-elements with Tailwind to create a vertical line connecting the cards.
    - **Styling:** Style each timeline event card with distinct sections for the description, user, and timestamp to improve readability. Add a subtle `hover:shadow-md` effect.

3.  **Refactor `JobAttachmentsTab.vue`:**

    - **Grid Layout:** Convert the file list into a responsive grid (`grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4`). Each grid item will be a `Card` representing a file.
    - **File Card Component:** Create a small, reusable `FileCard.vue` component to display a thumbnail/icon, filename, size, and action buttons.
    - **Image Preview:** Implement a lightbox for image previews using the `Dialog` component.
    - **Drag & Drop UI:** Enhance the drag-and-drop zone. When `isDragOver` is true, apply more prominent styles: `border-blue-500 bg-blue-50` and scale up an icon.

4.  **Refactor `JobPdfTab.vue`:**

    - **Investigation:** `package.json` (line 39) confirms the project uses `pdf-vue3`.
    - **Embedded Viewer:** Use the `pdf-vue3` component to embed the PDF viewer directly within the tab.

    ```html
    <!-- In JobPdfTab.vue -->
    <div class="flex-1 bg-gray-200 rounded-lg overflow-hidden">
      <pdf :src="pdfSrc" />
    </div>
    ```

    - **Toolbar:** Create a toolbar (`div` with `flex`) above the PDF viewer containing the "Download," "Print," and "Attach to Job" buttons.

5.  **Apply Consistent Styling to `JobSettingsTab` & `JobWorkflowTab`:**
    - **Sectioning:** Group related form fields within `Card` components, each with a clear `<CardHeader>` and `<CardTitle>`.
    - **Input Styles:** Ensure all `input`, `textarea`, and `select` elements share consistent styling for padding, borders, and `focus-visible` rings.

**UI/UX Enhancement Notes:**

- **Animations & Transitions:**
  - Use `transition-all duration-300` on interactive elements for smooth `hover` feedback.
  - New items added to lists should fade and slide into view.
  - Wrap the dynamic `:is="activeTabComponent"` in `JobViewTabs.vue` with `<Transition name="fade-slide" mode="out-in">` for polished tab switching.
  ```css
  /* in src/assets/main.css */
  .fade-slide-enter-active,
  .fade-slide-leave-active {
    transition:
      opacity 0.2s ease,
      transform 0.2s ease;
  }
  .fade-slide-enter-from,
  .fade-slide-leave-to {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(10px);
  }
  ```
- **Micro-interactions:** Add descriptive tooltips to all icon buttons.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Use typography (`font-semibold` for titles, `text-gray-600` for descriptions) to guide the user's eye.
- **Empty States:** Design visually engaging "empty state" components for when there is no history or no attachments, featuring an icon and a call-to-action.

**QA & Acceptance Criteria:**

- **[ ] UI:** All five tabs share a standardized container layout.
- **[ ] UI:** `JobHistoryTab` uses a `Collapsible` for its form and displays a visual timeline.
- **[ ] UI:** `JobAttachmentsTab` uses a responsive grid layout and has a lightbox for images.
- **[ ] UI:** `JobPdfTab` successfully embeds a PDF viewer using `pdf-vue3`.
- **[ ] UI:** Form elements and sections across all tabs are consistently styled.
- **[ ] UX:** Transitions between tabs and content are smooth and animated.
- **[ ] UX:** Animations on content entry (e.g., adding a new file) are present and fluid.
- **[ ] Responsiveness:** All redesigned tab layouts are fully responsive.
