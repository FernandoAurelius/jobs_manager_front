# Weekend Timesheets Feature Requirements

## Overview

Implement frontend integration for weekend timesheets functionality based on a backend feature flag. The system should dynamically adapt between 5-day (Mon-Fri) and 7-day (Mon-Sun) weeks based on the feature flag status.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Feature Flag Detection

- **FR-1.1**: Create a service to detect the weekend timesheets feature flag from backend company defaults
- **FR-1.2**: Cache feature flag status to avoid repeated API calls
- **FR-1.3**: Provide refresh mechanism for feature flag updates

### 2. Dynamic Week Configuration

- **FR-2.1**: Support both 5-day (Mon-Fri) and 7-day (Mon-Sun) week configurations
- **FR-2.2**: Automatically switch configuration based on feature flag
- **FR-2.3**: Update UI components to display appropriate number of days

### 3. UI Adaptations

- **FR-3.1**: Modify WeeklyTimesheetView to show dynamic day headers
- **FR-3.2**: Style weekend days differently when enabled (e.g., blue background)
- **FR-3.3**: Update IMS mode toggle to work with feature flag
- **FR-3.4**: Ensure responsive design for both configurations

### 4. Backend API Integration

- **FR-4.1**: Update weekly-timesheet.service.ts to handle dynamic day responses
- **FR-4.2**: Ensure API calls work with both 5-day and 7-day responses
- **FR-4.3**: Handle feature flag detection failures gracefully

### 5. Error Handling and Fallbacks

- **FR-5.1**: Provide fallback to 5-day mode if feature flag detection fails
- **FR-5.2**: Show user-friendly error messages for API failures
- **FR-5.3**: Maintain functionality during backend unavailability

### 6. Performance and UX

- **FR-6.1**: Minimize API calls through caching
- **FR-6.2**: Provide loading states during feature flag detection
- **FR-6.3**: Ensure smooth transitions between configurations

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Compatibility

- **NFR-1.1**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing 5-day system
- **NFR-1.2**: Support both enabled and disabled feature flag states
- **NFR-1.3**: No breaking changes to existing functionality

### 2. Performance

- **NFR-2.1**: Feature flag detection should not impact initial load time
- **NFR-2.2**: Cache feature flag status for session duration
- **NFR-2.3**: Optimize API calls to avoid unnecessary requests

### 3. Usability

- **NFR-3.1**: Clear visual indicators for weekend days when enabled
- **NFR-3.2**: Intuitive IMS mode toggle behavior
- **NFR-3.3**: Consistent user experience across different configurations

### 4. Maintainability

- **NFR-4.1**: Modular code structure for easy maintenance
- **NFR-4.2**: Clear separation of concerns between feature flag logic and UI
- **NFR-4.3**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Feature Flag Detection

- [ ] Feature flag is correctly detected from backend
- [ ] Fallback to 5-day mode when detection fails
- [ ] Feature flag status is cached and refreshed appropriately

### 2. Dynamic Configuration

- [ ] UI correctly displays 5 or 7 days based on feature flag
- [ ] Weekend days are visually distinguished when enabled
- [ ] IMS mode toggle works correctly with both configurations

### 3. API Integration

- [ ] Weekly overview API handles both response formats
- [ ] Error handling for API failures is implemented
- [ ] Performance optimizations are in place

### 4. User Experience

- [ ] Smooth transitions between configurations
- [ ] Clear visual feedback for different modes
- [ ] Responsive design maintained across screen sizes

### 5. Error Handling

- [ ] Graceful degradation when backend is unavailable
- [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] No data loss during configuration switches

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

- Backend feature flag implementation
- API endpoints for company defaults
- Weekly timesheet API with dynamic day support

### Internal Dependencies

- UI layout issues with dynamic day counts

### Medium Risk

- Caching strategy for feature flag status
- Error handling for edge cases
- Browser compatibility issues

### Low Risk

- Visual styling for weekend days
- Toggle component behavior
- Service layer modifications

## Success Metrics
