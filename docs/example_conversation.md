## 💬 Input Phase

**Estimator:**  
We need 3 boxes, 700×700×400, brushed stainless. Welded seams, open top.

**System:**  
You've entered:

- 3 × box
- Dimensions: 700×700×400 mm
- Material: brushed stainless

❓ Confirm: Is this 304/4, 1.2 mm gauge?  
(If not, please specify.)

**Estimator:**  
Yes, 304/4, 1.2 mm.

**System:**  
✅ Material confirmed.  
📦 Welded 5-face box, open top. Folded seam allowances will be applied.

Proceeding to material usage calculation.

## 📐 Material Calculation Phase

**System:**  
Unfolded layout: 4 sides + base = 5 faces  
Each face = 700×400 mm = 0.28 m²  
Total per box (before waste): 5 × 0.28 = 1.4 m²  
Applying 12% waste = 1.4 × 1.12 = **1.57 m² per box**  
Total for 3 boxes = **4.71 m²**

🔢 Method 1: Waste % → 4.71 m² ÷ 2.88 = 1.64 sheets

🔟 Method 2: Tenths-based

- Standard sheet = 2400×1200 = 10 tenths = 240×600 mm each
- Each part needs 6 tenths (700 mm spans width) → 3 × 6 = 18 tenths → 1.8 sheets

📏 Method 3: Proportional Billing

- Align 700 mm to 1200 side → 700/2400 = 29.1% per sheet
- 3 × 29.1% = 87.3% of a sheet → 0.873 sheets (for billing only)

📝 All methods agree on ~1.7–1.8 sheets used.

❓ Confirm to proceed with sheet pricing lookup?

**Estimator:**  
Confirmed. Proceed.

## 💰 Supplier Lookup Phase

**System:**  
Checking pricing via MCP tools...

**Supplier options:**  
| Supplier | Sheet Type | Price | Code | Delivery | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Rivtec | 304/4 1.2 mm | $198 | RVT-SS30412 | 2 days | In stock |

📌 Cheapest: Rivtec ($198)  
⚠️ Large price gap → please confirm supplier choice

**Estimator:**  
Stick with Rivtec. Confirmed.

## 🛠️ Labor Estimation Phase

**System:**  
Labor template: welded stainless box, 5 sides, 700 mm

- Cutting: 0.2 hrs/box
- Folding: 0.3 hrs/box
- Welding: 0.4 hrs/box
- Finishing: 0.25 hrs/box
- Total = 1.15 hrs/box × 3 = **3.45 hrs**

Hourly rate: $95 → Labor cost = **$327.75**

## 📦 Final Quote Output

| Item        | Qty  | Rate | Cost    | Notes                  |
| ----------- | ---- | ---- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| Sheet metal | 2    | $198 | $396.00 | 1.8 → rounded to 2     |
| Labor       | 3.45 | $95  | $327.75 | Welded box fabrication |
| Total       |      |      | $723.75 |                        |

Markup: 20%  
Quote total (excl. GST): **$868.50**
